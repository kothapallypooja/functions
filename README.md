# Factorial and Mathematical Function Calculator

This project features two mini-programs in Python:
1. **Recursive Factorial Calculator**
2. **Math Function Evaluator (Square Root, Logarithm, Sine)**

Together, they provide both practical examples of recursion and demonstrate the power of Python’s built-in `math` module.

##  Features

-  Calculates the **factorial** of any non-negative integer using recursion.
-  Uses `math` module functions to compute:
- **Square Root**
- **Natural Logarithm** (base *e*)
-  **Sine of the number (in radians)**
-  Clean, beginner-friendly code with modular structure.
-  Handles inputs with basic validation for better user experience.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x 
- No external libraries—only the built-in `math` module is used.

##  Installation

1. Install Python 
2. Clone or download this script into your working directory.

## How to Run & Use

1. Open your terminal or code editor.
2. Navigate to the script’s directory.
3. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. When prompted, input a positive number.
5. View results for:
   - Factorial
   - Square root
   - Natural logarithm
   - Sine value
